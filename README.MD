# Data Elegance in Bits

## Overview
This project explores and implements compression algorithms, specifically Huffman Coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression, to reduce the size of text data.

## Features
- Implementation of Huffman Coding and LZW Compression.
- Command-line interface for user input.
- Performance testing of algorithms based on execution time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
